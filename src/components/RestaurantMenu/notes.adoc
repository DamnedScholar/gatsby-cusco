* It's important to first have a complete page that doesn't rely on JavaScript. Gatsby should generate a static menu like it does now and the DOM structure of that menu should have robust "handles" for JS to grab onto and manipulate.
* tocca.js is a tiny touch library with no issues and recent maintenance.

## Expected Behavior
### Desktop
1. Load full-page menu displaying as many items as feasible. A sufficiently wide or tall window should be able to see the entire menu, but smaller windows shouldn't be crowded.
2. For screen readers, the page should introduce itself to the user and then proceed through the menu.
  * Should this be automated by default? What do people expect?

### Mobile
1. Tablets can load part of a full menu, or all headers with a lot of room. Maybe it's optimal to start with the entry section expanded and expand other sections as you go along.
2. Phones should start with just the headers.
3. For screen readers, the page should introduce itself and indicate that it's responsive to touch gestures.

## Interactive Menu Controls
* A single tap on a header gives it the class `.active-header` and re-renders its content with `aria-live="assertive"`.
* A single tap on an item gives it the class `.active-item` and re-renders its content with `aria-live="assertive"`.
* A swipe up steps to the previous item.
  - This means that individual items need to have keys and to be imported into an array that accurately represents how they'll be navigated.
* A swipe down steps to the next item.
* A swipe left pulls up an instruction menu.

I need to understand roles. https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tree seems like a good starting point.

https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_trees is a crummy example, but any real-syntax example is a good example.

The `aria-activedescendant` property lives on a parent element and the value should contain the `id` of a child or owned element. This should go on the menu container itself and be updated whenever the active item or header changes. https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-activedescendant
